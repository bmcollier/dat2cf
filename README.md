dat2cf: Convert 8-bit images to 16-bit images
---------------------------------------------

For use with retro adaptors and peripheral technology such as the RetroClinic Datacentre.

The program rewrites images which have come from 8-bit filesystems to a 16-bit layout, padded with zeros, to support 16-bit filesystems such as FAT16 as used on Compact Flash for media up to 2GB, and as used in a lot of recently built hardware accessories for retro computers.
